# Spell Caster Test

The intention is to find out if it is possible (and if it could be fun) to cast spells by
"drawing" them on the First Person Screen.

## Initial state

The starting point for this project was wholly created using parts from 2 different tutorials by `DevLogLogan`:

- [Godot 4 - Online Multiplayer FPS From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8D3vEx7NAE)
- [Godot 4 / Blender - Third Person Character From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VasHZZyPpYU)

I'll try to remember to add any other resources I use.
